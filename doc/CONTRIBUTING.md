# Contributing

Have a look at the TODO list of things if you want to do something that will very likely be accepted

Be civilized, avoid useless comments.

If you want to appear in the authors, you have to have made significant contributions.
It is up to previous contributors to allow your name or not.

AI-generated PRs that contribute nothing to the codebase except for moving things around will be refused.
Genuine refactorings significantly improving the code quality can be discussed.
